# MMU MSc Data Science 21/22 Shared Area

Shared repository of resources, data, articles, good practice, recommendations, and so on, for all those taking part in MSc Data Science 21/22 at MMU.

## How to contribute
Everyone is encouraged to contribute and gain some basic familiarity with the GitHub/git processes.
1. Start by [forking this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks).
2. You can then edit the README.md (here's a [markdown guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)) or add new files.
3. Once you have made your changes, use this guide to [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) for review.
4. After your changes are reviewed and integrated with the repository, you will show up as a contributor!

(Optional) You can also do the above in the command line. If you want to try it out, you can [start here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).

## Resources by topic

</ul>

### Computer science
* [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/) Harvard's introduction to computer science free online course; this is the exact same module they teach at Harvard, fantastic resource for filling in gaps in basic programming concepts.

### Maths & statistics
* [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/c/joshstarmer/playlists) - statistics YouTube channel
* [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/#lessons) - maths and probability videos
* [Statistics101](https://www.youtube.com/c/BrandonFoltz/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=3) - another YouTube statistics channel with easy to understand explanations (older)
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) - interctive & comprehensive maths courses

### Exploratory data analysis
* [Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/sesise0307/pydata2021-eda) - series of notebooks with step by step introduction to exploratory data analysis from PyData Global 2021

### Data visualisation
* [Financial Times' Visual Vocabulary](https://github.com/Financial-Times/chart-doctor/blob/main/visual-vocabulary/FT4schools_RGS.pdf) also [easier to read format](https://ft-interactive.github.io/visual-vocabulary/) shows types of graphs split into categories by meaning.
* [BBC Visual and Data Journalism Cookbook](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/#how_to_create_bbc_style_graphics) and [Medium article](https://medium.com/bbc-visual-and-data-journalism/how-the-bbc-visual-and-data-journalism-team-works-with-graphics-in-r-ed0b35693535) - how to create BBC-level graphs in R
* [Python Chart Gallery](https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/all-charts/): I've come across this a couple of times and it could be useful for a quick check of the code needed for producing a particular type of graph, specially those that might involve customisation. Not sure about the quality/consistency, but it looked fine at a first glance.
* [Python Tools for Data Visualisation `pyviz.org/`](https://pyviz.org/): "The PyViz.org website is an open platform for helping users decide on the best open-source (OSS) Python data visualization tools for their purposes, with links, overviews, comparisons, and examples."


### Machine learning
* [Killian Weinberger's machine learning lectures](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7p_I0qxYZP94vhesuLAWNA/videos) courtesy of Simon
* [Andreas C. MÃ¼ller's applied machine learning course](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~amueller/comsw4995s20/schedule/) - Spring 2020 
* [SciKit-Learn Machine Learning Map](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html), a resource to help you choose the right estimator for your data
