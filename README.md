# MMU MSc Data Science 21/22 Shared Area

Shared repository of resources, data, articles, good practice, recommendations, and so on, for all those taking part in MSc Data Science 21/22 at MMU.

## Resources by topic
### Computer science
* [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/) Harvard's introduction to computer science free online course; this is the exact same module they teach at Harvard, fantastic resource for filling in gaps in basic programming concepts.

### Maths & statistics
* [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/c/joshstarmer/playlists) - statistics YouTube channel
* [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/#lessons) - maths and probability videos
* [Statistics101](https://www.youtube.com/c/BrandonFoltz/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=3) - another YouTube statistics channel with easy to understand explanations (older)
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) - interctive & comprehensive maths courses

### Exploratory data analysis
* [Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/sesise0307/pydata2021-eda) - series of notebooks with step by step introduction to exploratory data analysis from PyData Global 2021

### Data visualisation
* [Financial Times' Visual Vocabulary](https://github.com/Financial-Times/chart-doctor/blob/main/visual-vocabulary/FT4schools_RGS.pdf) also [easier to read format](https://ft-interactive.github.io/visual-vocabulary/) shows types of graphs split into categories by meaning.
* [BBC Visual and Data Journalism Cookbook](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/#how_to_create_bbc_style_graphics) and [Medium article](https://medium.com/bbc-visual-and-data-journalism/how-the-bbc-visual-and-data-journalism-team-works-with-graphics-in-r-ed0b35693535) - how to create BBC-level graphs in R
* [Python Chart Gallery](https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/all-charts/): I've come across this a couple of times and it seemed useful; not sure about the quality/consistency, but it looked fine at a first glance.


### Machine learning
* [Killian Weinberger's machine learning lectures](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7p_I0qxYZP94vhesuLAWNA/videos) courtesy of Simon
* [Andreas C. MÃ¼ller's applied machine learning course](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~amueller/comsw4995s20/schedule/) - Spring 2020
